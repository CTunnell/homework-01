                Hello! My name is Chace Tunnell. My parents met in Alaska and my older brother was born in Hawai'i,
                but I was born in Houston and I've spent my whole life here. 
            </p>

                Since I'm working on a time crunch, I don't really have any good pictures of myself.
                This one is pretty much random; I just think drawing big eyes is neat.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>    I currently work as a petsitter/delivery driver. It's not particularly exciting, 
                but I do love animals, so that's fun.
            </p>
